# Rusty Type
TUI (Terminal User Interface) typing game written in Rust.
Aims to improve your typing speed and showing you your progress.
Words appear on the screen and disappear if you type them.

# Why?
Idea is to never care what you written before, if you see word and you press every key in the sequence, it dissapears.
This is something that annoys me on other apps of this kind, where you have to backspace to correct your mistakes.
